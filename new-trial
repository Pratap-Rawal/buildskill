this is edited using nano in vscode.
Now I am writing this sentence directly in the vscode window. Then I am going to save it with cntr plus s.
everytime I try to save items edited directly in the vscode, I must authenticate with password. It shows error.

Whenever the terminal is stuck with END press q to END

every time revert command is used a new commit is carried out and the head moves to this new commit.
