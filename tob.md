# Theory of Business

### Authored by: Peter F. Drucker

## Intro:

Irrespective of the nature, whether a for profit or not for profit; every organization has a theory of business.

Theory of business is the sum of assumptions a business has for its customers, markets, customers, competition, its own values and behavior, about the technology and its dynamics, about its own strengths and weaknesses, overall about what the organization gets paid for.

A clear, consistent, and focussed valid theory is extraordinaraly powerful in achieving organizational objectives.


## Policies - Practices - Procedures


##Theory of Business (TOB) has three main assumptions about the organization.

### 1. Assumption about the environment of the organization
        i. society and its structures
        ii. the market
        iii. the customer
        iv. the technology
Together all this defines what is an organization is paid for.

### 2. Assumptions about the mission of the organization:
        that is what an organizations considers meaningful results, how it makes a difference.
### 3. Assumptions about the core competencies needed to accomplish the organization's mission.
        where the organization must excel.


## *Four specifications for a valid Theory of Business*

### 1. The assummptions about the environment, mission, and core competencies must fit reality.

### 2. The assumptions in all three areas must fit one another ( example GM's inventions of cost accounting and capital allocation)

### 3. Theory of Business must be known and understood by all in the organization.

### 4. Theory of Business must be tested constantly. (it is not graven on tablets of stone)


## Theory of business is a Hypothesis for success of business.
